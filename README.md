To run the code, create input.txt contaning the value of Penalty C for the creation of each new segment, the number of coordinates N for which you want to find the best fit line(s) and the coordinates in the following order:
C
N
/*N coordinates in x y format, each in new line for (x,y) input coordinate*/

Now, run Main.java file. The output would be printed on console.
